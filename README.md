# Nairaland_politics_top_words

<h3>What are Nigerians Discussing? What are the top words and names in the nigerian political space?</h3>
<h3>I solved this problem by creating a word cloud using data <a href="https://github.com/saheedniyi02/Nairaland-Webscraping">(click here)</a> gotten from the politics section of Nairaland(Africa's largest discussion forum). I cleaned the data and removed some common words/ stopwords from the data before generating the Word Cloud.</h3>

<h3>The jupyter notebook <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15K8qCzw3XZdoy-gMTjFIunisjfqt7XT6?usp=sharing">(Colab link)</a> of the codes is contained in the repository.</h3>
